# Simple Multilayer Perceptron
A simple implementation of a multilayer perceptron with a linear learning rate scheduler using only numpy.

This is of no use to anybody and was simply a learning excersize so I could make sure I understood the backprop algorithm. I may use it as a base later if I wish to learn more about the internals of deep learning algorithms.
